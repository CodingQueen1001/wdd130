            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>I moved back to Idaho a couple years ago from Nevada. Before my family and I moved to Nevada, I owned and operated a Montessori Preschool. I have over sixteen years of experience teaching Preschool and Kindergarten classes. The Largest class I taught was a group of thirty-six three to five year olds and I loved it. In addition to teaching Preschool and Kindergarten classes, I also spent two years working in partial care programs with children that had behavioral issues, were severely abused and had mental disorders. I have also had the privilege of being a foster parent. Currently, I’m working towards a BS degree in Public Health at BYU-I and I’m very close to finishing.</p>
