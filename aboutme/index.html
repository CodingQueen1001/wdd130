    <h2>Ashley Hillstead</h2>
    <p>In my sophmore year of High School, I took a course very similar
        to this over the summer and I didn't know it at the time,
        but I would end up being able to graduate early because
        of that course and coming here to BYU-I a month after I 
        graduated. The course was super fun and my favorite thing
        was the CSS and how at the end it really looked like a 
        professional website but I had coded it completely from
        scratch. 
    </p>
    <p>Some of my favorite things are anything superhero related 
    (Marvel or DC/CW Arrowverse, but I do like Marvel better), and reading.
    My favorite superhero was Spiderman until I watched Endgame
    and Wandavision so now its Wanda or the Scarlet Witch. My 
    Favorite DC superhero is superman, but if you've seen the CW
    shows than its a tie between the Flash (Grant Gustin) and
    Green Arrow (Stephen Amell). 
    </p>
    <p> My other favorite thing to do is read. My favorite book 
    series are, Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, the Selection, 
    the Land of Stories, and Kingdom Keepers. My Favorite
    Harry Potter characters are Bellatrix lestrange, Luna Lovegood, 
    and Ginny Weasley. My Favorite Harry Potter Book is the Half-Blood
    prince and My Favorite Harry Pottter Movie is a tie between 
    Order of the Phoenix and The Second Deathly Hallows.
